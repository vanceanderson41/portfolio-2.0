                    In addition to modules for the PLPTool, I was a contributor in writing video tutorials using the PLPTool designed as supplement material used for a microprocessor course. The completed so far are aimed at teaching students fundamental assembly concepts, I/O, and UART and interrupt programming/handling.

                This is an introduction to PLPTool, and uses version 4.1 of the tool. The authors, Damon Cost (who also narrates in this video), Vance Anderson, and Sohum Sohoni bring you a short and simple program that aims to get you started on programming in assembly language using PLPTool.

                This tutorial uses version 4.1 of the PLPTool and aims to introduce memory-mapped input/output devices such as the seven-segment display, switches, and LEDs. The video also explores loops for the purpose of polling the switch values, basic jump operations, functions, and conditional branch instructions. It is authored by Damon Cost (narrator), Vance Anderson, and Dr. Sohum Sohoni.

                This tutorial uses version 4.1 of the PLPTool and aims to introduce the uses of the UART and interrupts. Polling for the UART is done using interrupts instead of a loop. The interrupt controller, ISRs (interrupt subroutines), and the UART's components are discussed in detail. It is authored by Damon Cost (narrator), Vance Anderson, and Dr. Sohum Sohoni.

                This tutorial breaks down the three instruction types (r, j, i) to show how they are different and what those differences are. It also steps each type through a simplified diagram of the processor's datapath to further illustrate how the different encodings behave in the hardware.
